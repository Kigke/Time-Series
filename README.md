# Time-Series
Time series analysis is a vital statistical technique for examining data points collected or recorded at time intervals. In R, it involves identifying patterns, trends, seasonality, and cyclical behavior within a dataset. A typical time series analysis begins with data visualization to understand underlying trends, followed by decomposition to separate the data into trend, seasonal, and residual components. Ensuring stationarity is crucial, as non-stationary data can mislead results; this is often checked using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test. If the data are not stationary, differencing is applied to stabilize the mean and remove trends or seasonality. The autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF) plots are then used to identify dependencies between observations. These steps help build models like ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average), which are fitted to forecast future values and gain insights into temporal data behavior. Râ€™s powerful packages, such as forecast, tseries, and ggplot2, make it a preferred choice for comprehensive time series analysis.
